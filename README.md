Personal Information Manager is a simple console-based Python application that:

Stores static personal details

Accepts additional inputs from the user

Validates user input

Displays all information in a formatted style

Performs basic calculation (age in months)

This project helped me learn fundamentals of Python programming.

During this project, I learned:

Variables — storing different data types

Input & Output — using input() and print()

String Formatting — using f-strings for clean output

Error Handling — validating user inputs

Basic calculations — converting age to months
